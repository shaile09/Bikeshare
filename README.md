# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.For this module, we started by looking at the Citi Bike data that has been released to the public for our analysis. However, we were cautious when looking at the data since it specifically applies to New York City and Des Moines is different. To start, answered the following analytical questions:
1) From the Citi Bike data, we found the total number of trips recorded during the month of August were 2,344,224.
2) We found that the proportion of short-term customers to annual subscribers. 80.07% of the population of the customers were annual subscribers and 18.93% were short-term subscribers. We now know the breakdown of rider types in New York City, which will help us predict the customer breakdown in Des Moines and, in turn, propose a business model to investors.
3) We determined the peak riding hours in the month of August based on the Citi Data. The top riding hours during August in New York City are 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. and the best time to preform maintenance on a bike is 2:00 am to 5:00 am. 
4) Identified the top starting locations and ending locations in New York City by creating a symbol map. 
5) Using a calculated field, we looked at the gender breakdown of active riders and customized the pie chart to display Unknown, Male, and Female.
6) Using the Citi Bike data, we looked at the average trip duration by age using the birth year. 
7) Using a treemap, we created a visual to see which bikes were due for repairs. 
8) Using a circle treemap, we created a visual to show which bikes have the highest utilization.


# Des Miones Data 

The external dataset that set that was used from the Census data - https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,desmoinescityiowa#

The goal of the challenge is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. So we created a persuasive story to help our users! We included information about both New York City and Des Moines. The investors should invest in a citi bike option for Des Moines as it will bring a lot of attention to the city. Here is what we found from our analysis of the census data in NYC vs Des Moines: 

1) We used structred and cleaned the census data prior to using it. From the dataset, we found that NYC has a population of 8,398,748 and 216,853 in Des Moines. Although the population in Des Moines is a lot lower, there are a lot of attractions for tourists. There are many attraction places that folks come to visit across the world. In addition, when NYC is compared to Des Moines, the city of Des Moines has a higher employment rate of 70% and NYC has an empoyment rate of 64%.

2) NYC and Des Moines have a similar computer usage and broadband subscription. Des Moines population is very tech savy and they would be able to use the Citi Bike share very fast. If they have an opportunity to use the city bike, they will use it very fast.

3) The income per capta and median household income is similar in the two cities. 
 NYC's median average income 60,762 and Des Moines is 52,251. Although the population in Des Moines is a lot less, the median income is closer to NYC (considering that the cost of living in NYC is a lot higher).
